        "This experience was a pivotal point in my personal growth journey, especially as a Minerva student, where I learned to embrace diverse identities. Previously, I had primarily identified myself through academic success, which limited my engagement with my body and well-being. However, during the pandemic, I decided to forge a healthier relationship with my body, starting with online yoga videos. This practice allowed me to feel strong and connected, motivating me to pursue Yoga Teacher Training, a decision that combined both my academic focus and personal growth. Throughout this training, I encountered challenges, humility, and a deep sense of connection to the yogic lifestyle. Graduating on April 15th marked the beginning of a new chapter in my journey of self-discovery and community engagement.",

Additionally, the U.S. Department of State periodically selects Alumni through a rigorous application to receive a grant in the amount of 1000 dollars to allow for continuity of projects for future endeavors.
