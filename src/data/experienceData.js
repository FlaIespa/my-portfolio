            "I was responsible for designing, implementing, and testing data pipelines to process experimental/microbiome data from the lab to a virtual warehouse. Processed data from scratch, creating five pipelines for the company: one with over 150 columns from S3 Bucket into Redshift (from AWS); the other four by creating an API with the database of a partnering company (Asimetrix) and load them also into Redshift (from AWS). Develop an application to expose, manipulate. Additionally, I designed an application to expose, manipulate, and analyze microbiome data in Python. Started the development of a client portal, a React App for both farmers and scientists to have a direct form of facilitated communication while exchanging data."
